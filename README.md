## How to Use

Before running the program for the first time, ensure that all required libraries are installed by executing:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Additionally, make sure the "models" directory contains the necessary pre-trained models. If not, execute ml.py.

This step is crucial for optimizing subsequent executions.

* Execute the app.py file. Ensure that it is selected as the current file.
* Open a web browser and enter "127.0.0.1:5000" in the search bar. Alternatively, if using an IDE like PyCharm with a console output, click on the link provided in the console.
* Input values in the designated spaces. Note that investment limits must be multiples of 10, and the risk factor should be between 0.35 and 1.
* Wait for the algorithm to complete and redirect you to the output page.
